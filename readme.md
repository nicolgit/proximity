# 📡 The Proximity Project 📡

**The Proximity Project** is a browser-based single-page application (SPA) that visualizes a map with isochrones—areas reachable within a certain distance or time—from the nearest railway or tram station. Currently focused on selected metropolitan areas in Italy, the project aims to help users understand how well-connected a location is via reliable rail-based public transport.

## 🌍 Why This Project?

In many parts of Italy—and often elsewhere—rail-based public transport (trains and trams) is significantly more reliable and punctual than road-based alternatives. This is largely due to the absence of traffic-related delays.

**The Proximity Project** is useful for:

- **Tourists** looking for short-term rentals in well-connected areas, even if they are not central.
- **Professionals** relocating for work who want to minimize car usage.
- **Families** seeking to reduce the number of cars needed by choosing a location with good public transport access.

## Features

- 🔍 **Address search**: Quickly find any location by typing an address.
- 📍 **Current location detection**: Automatically centers the map on your current position.
- 🗺️ **Global isochrone visualization**: Displays isochrones for the entire covered area, using color gradients to indicate distance from the nearest station—ideal for a quick visual overview.
- 🚉 **Station and stop display**: View all railway and tram stations/stops in the selected area.
- 🎯 **Station-specific isochrones**: Select a specific station or stop to view its individual isochrone.
- 🪧 **Interactive isochrones**: Click on any isochrone (global or station-specific) to see a popup showing the distance (in time) from the selected or nearest station.
